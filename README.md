# -AI-Game-Using-Binary-Tree
This project implements a simple text-based guessing game where the computer attempts to identify an ocean animal through a series of yes/no questions. The core of the game is a binary tree data structure, with each node representing a question or an answer. The user can teach the program new information if it fails to guess correctly.

ðŸŒŠ -AI-Game-Using-Binary-Tree Guessing Game project! Dive into the world of marine life and challenge the computer to guess the ocean animal you're thinking of.

Overview
This project implements a simple text-based guessing game where the computer attempts to identify an ocean animal through a series of yes/no questions. The core of the game is a binary tree data structure, with each node representing a question or an answer. The user can teach the program new information if it fails to guess correctly.

Features
Binary Tree Structure: The game utilizes a binary tree to systematically narrow down possibilities and make informed guesses.
Interactive Gameplay: Engage in a conversation with the computer, answering yes/no questions until it arrives at a conclusion.
Learning Mechanism: Teach the computer new information when it fails to guess correctly, enhancing its knowledge for future games.
Usage
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/ocean-animal-guessing-game.git
Run the main script: python ocean_animal_game.py
Follow on-screen instructions to play the game and teach the computer about ocean animals.
