# -AI-Game-Using-Binary-Tree
This project implements a simple text-based guessing game where the computer attempts to identify an ocean animal through a series of yes/no questions. The core of the game is a binary tree data structure, with each node representing a question or an answer. The user can teach the program new information if it fails to guess correctly.
